title: An Exploration and Comparison of Neural Network Libraries
excerpt: "There are a vast number of neural network libraries available to use. In this post, we will explore and compare the
performance of some of the most popular neural network libraries, as well as what happens behind the scenes in order to make 
them so efficient."

###Lasagne Installation
To look at the Lasagne install go the [Lasagne install blog post](http://pauljs.github.io/Dual-Booting-Ubuntu-and-Installing-Lasagne/) which includes a tutorial on dual booting Ubuntu with Windows. This was a part of the first blog post [The Power of Neural Networks and a Kickstart through Kaggle](http://pauljs.github.io/The-Power-of-Neural-Networks-and-a-Kickstart-through-Kaggle/)
