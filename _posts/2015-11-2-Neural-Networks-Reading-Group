Hello! This post is to keep you updated with the research papers, links, and tutorials I have found useful in learning 
Neural Networks from my start to the present. It will be updated as new material comes up and notes will be added for each,
depending on difficulty level and desire from comments! The hope of this blog is to demystify current techniques and
terminology in deep learning, which may seem scary at first. But don't worry! Questions are always welcome, and
the explanations will help translate any complexities. Happy learning!
