Hello! This post is to keep you updated with the research papers, links, and tutorials I have found useful in learning 
Neural Networks from my start to the present. It will be updated as new material comes up and notes will be added for each, depending on difficulty level and desire from comments! The hope of this blog is to demystify current techniques and terminology in Deep Learning, which may seem scary at first. But don't worry! Questions are always welcome, and
the explanations will help translate any complexities. Happy learning!

1. Rotation-invariant convolutional neural networks for galaxy morphology prediction
  1. This is a great introduction into applying neural networks. This paper uses deep learning to classify galaxies 
     from images provided by the [Galaxy Zoo project](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/). It clearly introduces deep learning 
     techniques including root-mean-square error (RMSE), feed-forward neural networks, etc. Key terminology in this 
     paper is further explained [here](), with references to locations of the terms in the paper.
2. Sparse coding
  1. Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images
