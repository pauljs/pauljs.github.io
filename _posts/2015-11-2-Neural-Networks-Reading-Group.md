Hello! This post is to keep you updated with the research papers, links, and tutorials I have found useful in learning 
Neural Networks from my start to the present. It will be updated as new material comes up and notes will be added for each, depending on difficulty level and desire from comments! The hope of this blog is to demystify current techniques and terminology in Deep Learning, which may seem scary at first. But don't worry! Questions are always welcome, and
the explanations will help translate any complexities. Happy learning!

1. Rotation-invariant convolutional neural networks for galaxy morphology prediction
  a. This is a great introduction into applying neural networks. This paper uses deep learning to classify galaxies from
     images provided by the [Galaxy Zoo project](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/). It clearly introduces deep learning  
     techniques including root-mean-square error (RMSE), feed-forward neural networks, etc. Key terminology in this paper      is further explained [here](), with references to locations of the terms in the paper.
2. Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images
3. Efficient Sparse coding algorithms
4. Extracting and Composing Robust Features with Denoising Autoencoders
5. Contractive Auto-Encoders: Explicit Invariance During Feature Extraction
6. Learning Deep Architectures for AI: Chapter 5 Energy-Based Models and Boltzmann Machines
7. Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations (2009)
8. Yoshua Bengio's online book Deep Learning: Chapter 6 Feedforward Deep Networks and Chapter 9 Convolutional Networks
9. Recursive Neural Networks
  a. The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks
  b. Recurrent Neural Networks Tutorial, Part 1 â€“ Introduction to RNNs
  c. Understanding LSTM Networks
  d. University of Toronto's slides on Recurrent Neural Networks
10. Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks
